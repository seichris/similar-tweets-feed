# My Twitter Extension

This Chrome extension displays Similar Tweets in the sidebar. Simply click the ⚡ below a tweet.

# How it works

Clicking the ⚡ button opens a tab with the `/similar` for that tweet. It grabs the 10 first Tweets' HTML from the DOM. And adds them to the sidebar, back in the first tab.

# Feature ideas

- Get images from opened tab. (Challenge is that lazy load only loads when user on the website.)
- Add links to tweets.
- Instead of clicking the button, get Similar Tweets automatically based on the Tweet that is in view.
